**Project Documentation: Workers Management System**

**1. Introduction:**
The Workers Management System is a web-based application designed to manage workers' information within an organization. It provides functionalities for registering new workers, updating existing worker details, deleting workers, and managing user roles. The system aims to streamline the process of managing worker data and ensure efficient organization and retrieval of information.

**2. Structure:**
The Workers Management System consists of several key components:

- **Frontend Interface:** The user interacts with the system through a web-based interface. This interface is responsible for displaying forms for data entry, presenting worker information in tables, and facilitating user interactions.
  
- **Backend Server:** The backend server handles HTTP requests from the frontend interface and interacts with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on worker data. It is responsible for processing form submissions, validating input, and executing database queries.

- **Database:** The database stores all worker-related data, including information such as usernames, passwords, names, email addresses, and roles. It provides a structured way to store and retrieve worker information efficiently.

**3. Functionality:**
The Workers Management System offers the following functionality:

- **User Registration:** New users can register by providing their username, password, name, and email address. Upon registration, their information is stored securely in the database.

- **User Login:** Registered users can log in to the system using their credentials. Upon successful authentication, they gain access to the system's features based on their assigned roles.

- **Worker Management:** Authenticated users with appropriate permissions can perform CRUD operations on worker data. They can add new workers, view existing worker details, update worker information, and delete workers from the system.

- **Role-based Access Control:** The system implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain functionalities based on user roles. For example, administrators may have access to all features, while regular users may only be able to view worker information.

**4. Usage:**
To use the Workers Management System, follow these steps:

- **Access the Web Interface:** Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the Workers Management System is hosted.

- **User Registration/Login:** If you are a new user, click on the registration link and provide the required information to create an account. If you already have an account, log in using your credentials.

- **View Worker Information:** Upon successful login, you will be able to view a list of workers and their details. You can use the search and filter functionalities to locate specific workers.

- **Add/Update/Delete Workers:** Depending on your role and permissions, you can add new workers, update existing worker information, or delete workers from the system. Follow the on-screen instructions and fill out the required forms to perform these actions.

- **Log Out:** Once you have finished using the system, log out of your account to secure your session.

**5. Conclusion:**
The Workers Management System offers a user-friendly interface for managing worker information efficiently. By centralizing worker data and providing role-based access control, it helps organizations streamline their workforce management processes and maintain data integrity.
